## About

Barn is a sophisticated command-line interface (CLI) tool that excels in managing, tokenizing, and securely encrypting data through a RESTful API implemented in Rust. Barn offers an advanced cryptographic solution — more sophisticated and intuitive than current industry leaders — that ensures data confidentiality and integrity.

This tool was developed to offer a dependable alternative in the wake of significant industry consolidations, such as IBM's acquisition of HashiCorp. Have no fear, however! Barn promises to develop robust, cutting-edge secrets management solutions at lightning-fast speeds, thus ensuring prosperity in the land. Welcome to the Barnyard.

### Start the Server

To start the Barn server, run:
```sh
./barn serve --address 127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Encrypt and Store Data

To securely store data with encryption, use the following curl command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/store -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"key\": \"exampleKey\", \"value\": \"exampleValue\"}'
```

This command encrypts the value and stores it under the specified key.

### Decrypt and Retrieve Data

To retrieve and decrypt data, use the following curl command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/load -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"key\": \"exampleKey\"}'
```

This retrieves the encrypted data using the specified key and decrypts it.

### Example Workflow

1. **Start the Server**:
    ```bash
    ./barn serve --address 127.0.0.1:8000
    ```

2. **Encrypt and Store Data**:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/store -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"key": "exampleKey", "value": "exampleValue"}'
    ```

    Example response:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Key-value pair stored successfully"
    }
    ```

3. **Decrypt and Retrieve Data**:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/load -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"key": "exampleKey"}'
    ```

    Example response:
    ```json
    {
      "value": "exampleValue"
    }
    ```

### Viewing Logs

For detailed logs of server activities, including encryption and decryption operations, set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to `info` before starting the server:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info ./barn serve --address 127.0.0.1:8000
```
